First of all make sure you have docker installed on your machine and docker daemon is running on your machine

We want to run two sites simultaneously in our machine so that we will create another docker-machine

We need to create a docker-machine as a main docker-machine, 
To create a docker-machine we can execute following commands

docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
docker-machine ls
docker-machine ip default

to create another docker-machine, execute following commands

docker-machine create --driver virtualbox dev1
docker-machine ls
docker-machine ip dev1

Now, We have two docker-machines created,
Here we will assume that default docker machine is binded with IP 192.168.99.100
And dev1 docker machine is binded with IP 192.168.99.101

We need to start each of the docker-machines if not already started

docker-machine start default
docker-machine start dev1

Now, we can create container in each docker-machine and we can run those containers simultaneously,
We will create development container in default docker-machine and admin container in dev1 docker-machine,
for that we need to switch to default docker-machine, for that execute following commands


docker-machine env default

eval $(docker-machine env default)

curl -L "https://rcms-backup.s3.amazonaws.com/install_shell/dockerfile_49a5fdef090d27d57bfae3b3baa685da?AWSAccessKeyId=15TV6X9W3KCCT8808ER2&Expires=1437646506&Signature=TMNiD7iHZCsxFDW%2FL6p%2FfcWpvpo%3D" | docker build -t rcms-120673 - && docker run --name "aio-admin.r-cms.jp-120673-n2DuGKJfZSd3" -v $GIT_RCMS/RCMS-OpenDev-ClosedBeta/nfs/:/home/rcms/nfs/ --privileged=true -p 80:80 -p 22 -p 5432:5432 -d rcms-120673 /usr/bin/supervisord


after creating and configuring the container we can create admin container in dev1 docker-machine 
For that we will switch the docker-machine using following command

eval $(docker-machine env dev1)

we will create admin container using docker script for admin container
curl -L "https://rcms-backup.s3.amazonaws.com/install_shell/dockerfile_49a5fdef090d27d57bfae3b3baa685da?AWSAccessKeyId=15TV6X9W3KCCT8808ER2&Expires=1437646506&Signature=TMNiD7iHZCsxFDW%2FL6p%2FfcWpvpo%3D" | docker build -t rcms-120673 - && docker run --name "aio-admin.r-cms.jp-120673-n2DuGKJfZSd3" -v $GIT_RCMS/RCMS-OpenDev-ClosedBeta/nfs/:/home/rcms/nfs/ --privileged=true -p 80:80 -p 22 -p 5432:5432 -d rcms-120673 /usr/bin/supervisord


After completion of creation of both containers, we have two containers running in two different docker-machines

Now, For connection of database from container to another container, we need to change postgres configuration
For that change the configuration as below

Open the bash of the container using following command
docker exec -it aio-admin.r-cms.jp-120673-n2DuGKJfZSd3 bash

Change configuration for postgres, open following file in vi using command below
vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/pg_hba.conf
ge
and add following line
host all all 192.168.99.0/24 trust

Change configuration for postgres, Open following file in vi using 	
vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/postgresql.conf 

and add following line
listen_addresses='*'


To check whether the postgres is able to connect from admin container to development container, we can check using following command
psql -h 192.168.99.100 --user postgres

If it will be able to connect then it will show the postgre prompt otherwise it will show some failure message


Now, for admin site to be functional on dev1 docker-machine, we have to change some configuratin in the container
for that purpose open bash shell of admin site using following command

e.g. docker exec -it aio-admin.r-cms.jp-120673-n2DuGKJfZSd3 bash

Change IP in default.php like following

vi /home/rcms/120673/lib/default.php
define("ROOT_URL","http://192.168.99.101");
define("ROOT_SSL_URL","http://192.168.99.101‚Äù);

And then we need to change the symbolic link in the /home/vhosts/ directory

rm 192.168.99.100
ln -s /home/rcms/120673/html 192.168.99.101
